## Target User Profile
My website is for professionals or companies looking to hire me or learn about my professional background. It's made for people interested in my professional life and possible work opportunities.

## Information Architecture
The code is divided into sections that can be accessed by scrolling through the page or via the index. The initial section is 'Experience,' summarizing my work life. The following section is 'Education,' highlighting my academic background. The places where I've worked or studied are clickable, directing to their respective webpages. 'Skills' is the third section, visually presenting my programming proficiency levels, and 'Language' follows, summarizing my linguistic abilities. Lastly, there is a 'Contact' section. Currently, it's non-functional; it's just a template, as it requires a different programming language to operate, but I aim to implement its functionality. The website is responsive, functioning seamlessly on both mobile devices and computers. 

## Visual Design
I've given particular attention to how the page looks, understanding that it forms the initial impression for anyone interested in me or my work. To maintain a simple and minimalistic design, I opted for a blue color palette, which I've consistently applied throughout the project. I first integrated this color scheme using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/aqxNkHoEJwUuBvawBmOTrO/Untitled?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=3ib7nay0jW75K4s3-1) and later translated it into HTML and CSS. For the icons, I utilized [RemixIcons](https://remixicon.com/). All images used in this project are stored in the "images" folder.
